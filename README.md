The only thing needed to execute the project is to open the file called flexdashboard.html. Because of a bug in the package, you will probably need to refresh the browser in order to graphs to appear in the second and fourth tabs of the board. Our code is also included in the dashboard but we also uploaded our .rmd.

The paper is uploaded as a .docx document available in the repository. 

In this project, Dolores was in charge of the income data and Maria of the demographic data, we worked separately in the data and graphs and we worked together writing the paper and on the flexdashboard.
